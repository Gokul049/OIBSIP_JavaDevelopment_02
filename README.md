#💳Project Report: ATM Interface System in Java

#🎯Objective

To simulate a simple ATM banking system using object-oriented principles in Java that allows users to create an account, login securely, deposit money, withdraw cash, transfer funds, and view a mini statement.

#🛠️Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java

Tools/IDE: IntelliJ IDEA 

Java Concepts Used:

      Classes and Objects

      Encapsulation (Getters/Setters)

      Control Structures (if-else, switch-case, loops)

      ArrayList for storing transaction history

      Scanner for user input


#📋Features Implemented

🧑‍💼 1. Account Creation

🚪 7. Exit
      Allows the user to exit the program safely.


#🧠Core Concepts Practiced

OOP Principles(Encapsulation via private attributes & methods), Input Handling(Using Scanner class for user interaction), Condition Checking(Validation of input ranges and choices),
Data Structures(ArrayList<String> for storing transaction history), User Feedback(Real-time messages confirming actions or errors).
